\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
The work presented in this thesis would not have been possible without the help of my supervisors, co-workers, colleagues, and friends.

I would like to thank my core committee: Prof. Loe Feijs, Dr. Jun Hu and Prof. Panos Markopoulos. I would also like to thank the members of my reading committee: Prof. Harold Thimbleby, Dr. Stefan Wensveen and Prof. Johan Lukkien.

Bram van der Vlist, my colleague and friend --- who was my co-captain on this adventure --- without you this would definitely not have been possible.

I would like to thank Aly Syed, Riccardo Trevisan, Sriram Srinivasan, Hans van Amstel, Stefan Rapp, Sachin Bhardwaj and Tanir Ozcelebi for their contributions to the smart home pilot.

While working on the software tools and application described in this thesis, Holger Knublauch and Scott Henninger from TopQuadrant were always ready to provide me with assistance. 

I will always remember my PhD colleagues who I shared an office with at the university: Alex Juarez, Sibrecht Bouwstra, Roman Gorbunov, Jan Gillesen, Misha Croes and Marija Nakevska. You guys made my three years at TU Eindhoven very enjoyable.

Also, I would like to thank my parents and my brother: \emph{Ma, Pa en Riaan - baie dankie vir julle ondersteuning and dat julle in my glo.} And my girlfriend, Margriet van de Goor, thank you so much!
