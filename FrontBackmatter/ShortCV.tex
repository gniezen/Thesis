\chapter*{Curriculum Vitae}
Gerrit Niezen was born in Pretoria, South Africa, on 29 September 1982. He received BEng Computer Engineering and MEng Computer Engineering (with distinction) degrees from the University of Pretoria in South Africa. After spending a brief period in industry, he returned to the University of Pretoria as a lecturer, teaching undergraduate classes in software engineering and network security, as well as a postgraduate class in wireless sensor networks. Gerrit's research interests include interaction design, semantic web technologies, wireless sensor networks, ubiquitous computing and gesture recognition. He joined the Designed Intelligence research group at TU Eindhoven in July 2009. His research involved determining how user interaction in a smart space can be better supported by ontology modelling. His research is part of a larger EU project to improve interoperability between devices in a smart environment. This technological design is the results from the work in the years 2009 to 2012.
